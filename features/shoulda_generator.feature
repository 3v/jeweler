Feature: shoulda generator
  In order to start a new gem
  A user should be able to
  generate a project setup for shoulda

  Scenario: directory layout
    Given a working directory
    And I have configured git sanely
    And I intend to test with shoulda
    When I generate a project named 'the-perfect-gem' that is 'zomg, so good'

    Then a directory named 'the-perfect-gem/test' is created
    And a file named 'the-perfect-gem/test/test_helper.rb' is created
    And a file named 'the-perfect-gem/test/the_perfect_gem_test.rb' is created

  Scenario: Rakefile
    Given a working directory
    And I have configured git sanely
    And I intend to test with shoulda
    When I generate a project named 'the-perfect-gem' that is 'zomg, so good'

    Then Rakefile has 'test/**/*_test.rb' in the Rake::TestTask pattern
    And Rakefile has 'test/**/*_test.rb' in the Rcov::RcovTask test_pattern
    And Rakefile has 'test' in the Rcov::RcovTask libs

  Scenario: generated test
    Given a working directory
    And I have configured git sanely
    And I intend to test with shoulda
    When I generate a project named 'the-perfect-gem' that is 'zomg, so good'

    Then 'test/the_perfect_gem_test.rb' should define 'ThePerfectGemTest' as a subclass of 'Test::Unit::TestCase'

  Scenario: generated test helper
    Given a working directory
    And I have configured git sanely
    And I intend to test with shoulda
    When I generate a project named 'the-perfect-gem' that is 'zomg, so good'

    Then 'test/test_helper.rb' requires 'test/unit'
    And 'test/test_helper.rb' requires 'shoulda'
    And 'test/test_helper.rb' requires 'mocha'
    And 'test/test_helper.rb' requires 'the_perfect_gem'
